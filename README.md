# Mazebot
This is my solution for [Maze Bot API]( https://github.com/noops-challenge/mazebot/blob/master/API.md). Maze Bot API sends mazes to be solved by your Code. It has a Race mode as well, in which the API sends 11 different Mazes of varying dificulty level(increasing order) to be solved by your code. The Last Maze sent by API is most complex and is a matrix of 200*200.

If your code Solves all the Mazes in race mode then GitHub gives you a certificate of completion. More about the Api can be found [here]( https://github.com/noops-challenge/mazebot/blob/master/API.md).

## About the Code
The code solves the race mode Of the maze bot api effectively. It uses Dijsktras Algorithm to solve the mazes.

## Certificate
The best timing that the code has attained in the race mode is 19.166 sec .
